                <li>Rinse and peel the Russet potatoes</li>
                <li>Slice potatoes into desired length and thickness.</li>
                <li>Transfer over cut potatoes into an ice bath with a pinch some salt for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Boil some water in a pot and add potatoes in. Boil for 6 minutes <strong>we do not want them to be tender</strong>.</li>
                <li>Completely dry the fries, and add them to a tray or bowl. Sprinkle the cornstarch and shake until coated evenly.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat until the oil reaches about 250°F. You don't want to be the oil to be that hot for the first fry.</li>
                <li>Add the French fries and flash fry for 3 to 5 minutes. They will not be golden but they'll hold their shape well. Fry in batches so the pan is not over-crowded.</li>
                <li>Get the oil hotter now, about 350°F. Add the fries back in and fry until beautifully golden and crispy, making sure to move them around so they evenly brown and crisp up.</li>

                <li>Add to a bowl along with the garlic butter. Toss around so the fries are coated evenly. Taste and adjust salt if needed.</li>
